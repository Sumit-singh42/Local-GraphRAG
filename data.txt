SUBJECT: The Veridian-Kalt Intercept // FILE CODE: 99-Z
The rapid insolvency of Veridian Dynamics cannot be understood without examining the shadow ledger maintained by Arthur Penhaligon, the disgraced former CIO of the company who was replaced in 2021 by his rival, Sarah Jenson. While public records state Jenson controls the primary accounts, internal memos recovered from the server at 44 Blackwood Drive indicate that Penhaligon never relinquished access to the "Onyx Protocol" mainframe, which routes verified transactions from Veridian’s subsidiary, Kalt Logistics, directly to a blind trust known as The Azure Foundation. The Azure Foundation is not a charity but a holding vehicle registered in the Seychelles, legally represented by the firm 2110 Legal, whose primary partner is Marcus Thorne. Thorne is currently under investigation for facilitating bribes on behalf of OmniFuture, a rival to Veridian, but evidence suggests Thorne is actually a double agent working for Veridian’s majority shareholder, The Silas Group. The Silas Group is a venture capital firm led by Eleanor Vance, who is secretly the biological mother of Arthur Penhaligon, a fact obscured by a falsified adoption record filed in 1985 in the town of Oakhaven. This familial link explains why The Silas Group continued to pour capital into Kalt Logistics even after Kalt lost its shipping license in the Atlantic Corridor. The money from The Silas Group does not stay in Kalt; it is immediately converted into untraceable cryptocurrency tokens called VoidCoins, which are stored in a cold wallet physically located in a safety deposit box at Zurich Sovereign Bank, Box 772. The only individual with the physical key to Box 772 is not Eleanor Vance or Arthur Penhaligon, but a surprisingly low-level courier named Davin Cole. Davin Cole is listed on the payroll of RedDagger Security, a private military contractor that provides security for the Keralus Rare Earth Mine. The Keralus Mine is the sole supplier of raw lithium for OmniFuture’s new battery project, Project Aether. This reveals a circular dependency where OmniFuture is unknowingly purchasing lithium that was subsidized by their rival Veridian’s laundered money, effectively making OmniFuture a client of the very people they are trying to destroy. To make matters worse, the "Sarah Jenson" who signed the insolvency papers for Veridian is actually an identity thief named Clara Voight, as the real Sarah Jenson died in a skiing accident in the Alps three months prior to the signing, a death that was ruled accidental but witnessed by operatives from RedDagger Security.
